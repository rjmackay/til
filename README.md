# Today I Learned

[A knowledgebase of little learnings](http://til.robbiemackay.com/).

## Contributing

1. Open a new pull request against this repository (using a feature branch).
2. Add a markdown file with your learnings under `source/posts/`, or you can ask middleman to create one for you:

```
$ middleman article "Your new post’s title"
```

3. Add YAML front-matter for the post's `title`, publishing `date`, your name as `author`, and a comma-separated list of `tags`
4. Short is sweet. Your learning doesn't need to be lengthy. A few sentences and some example code is enough. The markdown is parsed as [GFM](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) so you can used fenced code-blocks with syntax highlighting.

## Building the site

The site is _(well, will be)_ built automatically when new posts are merged into the `master` branch.

You can run it locally thusly:

```
$ bin/setup
$ bundle exec rake watch
```

This’ll spin up the development server on `http://localhost:4567`.

To build out the static files into `build/` run:

```
$ bundle exec rake build
```
